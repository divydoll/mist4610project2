**Describing your dataset and what data it contains**

Our data was obtained from the US Data Gov website and is about the average prices of fruits and vegetables from 2022. There are 1 excel file for the fruits and 1 for the vegetables. Each row of the sheet is a name of a specific fruit. The columns consist of:
Form - fresh, canned, juice, frozen, etc.
Retail Price - how much it costs at sale
Retail Price Unit - the quantity sold at sale
Yield - the proportion of the food that is edible and usable after preparation or processing, accounting for waste or inedible portions such as cores, peels, or other parts that are removed during preparation.
Cup Equivalent Size - the size or weight of the food item required to make one cup equivalent in terms of nutritional value.
Cup Equivalent Unit - the unit of measurement for the cup equivalent size.
Cup Equivalent Price - the calculated price for the food item to provide one cup equivalent, based on the retail price per unit of the food item and the cup equivalent size.


**What is the relationship between the different forms fruit is sold in and the average retail price for apples, grapes, oranges, and berries?**

This graph is useful for comparing the average cost of many different forms of fruit and then comparing the different fruits to each other. It can help customers no which fruit and form would give them the best value depending on their preferences. A few ways this graph could be made better is the fact that if a form of fruit has only one fruit in it then its AVG is going to be a lot lower because they are stacked on top of each other. Also, it is hard to compare different forms of the same fruit to each other because they are on various levels. This would require a separate graph for each fruit.


**How does the cup equivalent price relate to the retail price of different forms of vegetables?**

This is where you can see the trendlines between the different forms of vegetables. This could be useful to see the price variation between various forms and to see which vegetable will have the best bang for your pick when comparing how much you get for each price. This graph would be more useful if we could compare the seasonal change in prices, and the useful yield for the amount you buy, or have more data available to accurately compare the different forms. As you can see, there are only four data points for dried vegetables, and the trendline is very different from the other three as a result.

**Manipulations**

We used AVG(Retail Price) for each fruit in a specified form to get an approximate comparison between the different forms and types of fruit. There were only about five retail prices on average, so the sample size was very small. 

**Analysis and Results**

Analyze and visualize the results of your analysis and describe the implications of your analysis. Please provide any citations if required as well as supporting visualizations and analysis generated from Tableau
_  Question 1_: fresh fruits have higher prices compared to frozen and dried fruits, this could be because of factors such as freshness, taste, and convenience. Fresh berries could be more expensive due to a shorter shelf life and labor costs. Canned and frozen fruits offer more affordable options especially during off-seasons. Retailers can price different fruit forms to cater to different consumer segments. Offering a mix of fresh, frozen, and dried fruits can attract a wider consumer base. 
_  Question 2_: There is a positive correlation between the cup equivalent price and the retail price of vegetables. As cup equivalent price increases, retail price increases. Vegetables with higher nutritional density have higher prices.
